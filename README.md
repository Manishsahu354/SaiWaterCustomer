<b>Problem Statement</b></br>
Water management solution.

We found that Water tanker supplier are not able to keep the track of their customer and driver manually and they are facing many issues such as
Generating the bills of different societies.
Tracking the drivers
When to fill the tanks for the daily users
Keeping the track of order status (fulfilled,onGoing,remaining)


I live in a society where we need to purchase a water tanker every day.secretary have to communicate and coordinate with suppliers every time whenever our main society tank gets empty.sometime drivers don't come on time,they also even cheat customer while fill the tank,because there is no one to monitor them.It also affect the customer relationship.supplier also need to keep record of each tanker manually and keep the track of payment.They Also need to provide month bills to society but because of manual entries there are lots of error in it.

So we are here to solve this problem. 
We have Developed an ecosystem which provides hassle free service between the water providers and customers using Android app and IoT Device which will continuously monitor the water level inside the tank and with the help of smart algorithms automatic ordering of new tankers will be placed and we will also keep drivers in loop.


<b>We have develop 3 different app </b></br>
Customer</br>
Suppliers App -https://github.com/Tejeet/SaiWaterSuppliers </br>
Drivers App - https://github.com/harshkamaliya/SaiWaterDriver</br>


Flow of Ordering
Based on water level inside the tank, the user will get notification if water level is below threshold(decide by user)so they can manually or automatically place the order to suppliers.Now suppliers can fulfill the order by assigning them to driver and as soon as driver accept it,status of the order changes to onGoing,and while driver is filling the tank an real time data will be shared to the customer.
